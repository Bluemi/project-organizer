# conventions

When defining a subconcept C for a parentconcept D, where C is a specialization for D:
	you write `Sub: "c/C"` into the c/D file.

In C++:
	When a concept declares a class: it is denoted as `class X;` or `class X { ... };`
	When a concept adds new things to a class X, it is denoted as `X { ... };`.

	This also works with inheritance:
	X : D; # The X-class (which is defined anywhere recursively in the DependsOn section), is now a subclass of D
