/		Contains c,t,p,i,b-folders which contain all concepts/tasks/problems/implementations/bugs. Every Task with name <name> is stored as the file /t/<name> and so on...
/root: 		The project will be defined here. In addition to the Task-Template it containes "Ideas" and a "Begin Date"

Description:
	Task:
		A "task" describes what has to be done, NOT how to do it.

	Concept:
		A "concept" describes how to do something, NOT what to do.

	Bug:
		A run-time error, which has to be debugged in order to detect the Problem or Implementation-error which caused this.

	Problem:
		A concept problem, which may be caused by clashing concepts or just one failing concept itself.


Templates:
	Task:
		(Name):			The name of the Task
		Description:		First sentence is TL;DR. Should contain a list of features
		Approximate Duration:	in work hours
		Priority:		0.0 bis 1.0
		Done:			Yes/No
		Concepts:		List<Concept>, concepts which attempt to solve the Task

	Concept:
		(Name):			The name of the Concept
		Description:		First sentence is TL;DR
		Rating:
			Prediction:	as Text written before implementation, 
			Review:		as Text written after implementation
		Implementations/Tasks:	List<Implementation/Task>, subtasks and if the answer to the task is trivial an implementation
		Problems:		List<Problem>, list of produced problems

	Problem:
		(Name):			The name of the Problem
		Description:		first sentence is TL;DR
		Bugs:			List<Bug>, list of produced Bugs
		CausedBy:		List<Concept>, list of Concepts which clash and therefore cause this problem.

	Implementation:
		(Name):			The name of the Implementation
		Header/Class-Diagram:	A way to represent the implementation
		Bugs:			List<Bug>, list of produces Bugs directly caused by this implementation

	Bug:
		(Name):			The name of the Bug
		Description:		First sentence is TL;DR
		Inclusion:		Criterion for Inclusion
		Exclusion:		Criterion for Exclusion
		CausedBy:		Problem/Implementation, the reason for this bug.
		Logs:			List<Log>, list of documented Test-Logs.
					Logs contain:
						- test-setup (commit hashes)
						- test-result

# TODO excludes: "Some concepts/implementations explicitly exclude some things -- as a generic parameter in class C, prevents using a List<C>"
