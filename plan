Classes are Concept, Bug and Problem.
These classes are generally referred to with their lowercase inital letter (c, b, p).
Objects are instances of these classes, which are stored in files.

In every object, you can put so-called here-objects, which allow you to create an object just by using a name and a (short) description.
The syntax is [<class-letter>/<name>: <description>].

For example:
[c/Screen: Provides functions for rendering to the screen]

/		Contains c,p,b-folders which contain all objects (of the particular class). Every Concept with name <name> is stored as the file /c/<name> and so on...
/root: 		The project will be defined here. It's sample is in samples/r.

Concept:
	A "concept" describes what to do, and how to do it.

	Approximate Duration:	in work hours
	Description:		First sentence is TL;DR. Describes subtasks for this concept.
	Sub.<x>:		A list of all concepts for a specific subtask <x>.
	DependsOn:		List of concepts which are necessary for this concept. The stuff defined in the dependencies are usable from here.
	Rating:
		Prediction:	as Text written before implementation, 
		Review:		as Text written after implementation

Bug:
	A run-time error, which has to be debugged in order to detect the Problem or Implementation-error which caused this.

	Description:		First sentence is TL;DR
	Inclusion:		Criterion for Inclusion
	Exclusion:		Criterion for Exclusion
	CausedBy:		Problem/Concept, the reason for this bug.
	Logs:			List<Log>, list of documented Test-Logs.
				Logs contain:
					- test-setup (commit hashes)
					- test-result

Problem:
	A concept problem, which may be caused by clashing concepts or just one failing concept itself.

	Description:		first sentence is TL;DR
	CausedBy:		List<Concept>, list of Concepts which clash and therefore cause this problem.

# TODO excludes: "Some concepts explicitly exclude some things -- as a generic parameter in class C, prevents using a List<C>"
